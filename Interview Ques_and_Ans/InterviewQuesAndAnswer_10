// Question: What is the correct answer of the below code?


public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
   int j = 0;
    if ((8 > 4) | (j++ == 7))
    System.out.println("j = " + j);
  }
}


Output :-
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. ArithmeticException (Divided by zero)

Answer: Option B
Explanation:First value of j is declared as zero and then checks whether 8>4 or j++ == 7 .The second condition j++ == 7 is false and first condition is true(8>4).So it prints the value of j by incrementing
            to position because +j.
