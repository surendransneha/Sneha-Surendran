//Question: What is the output of the below code?


class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 0;
    int y = 10;
    do {
        y--;
        ++x;
      } while (x < 5);
        System.out.print(x + "," + y);
    }
 }
 
 
Output :-
A. 5, 6
B. 5, 5.
C. 6, 5
D. Error

Answe:Option B
Explanation:   i)The value of y gets decremented and becomes 9 and x gets incremented and becomes 1. and checks x<5(which is true.
              ii) y=8  x=2 checks x<5(true)
             iii) y=7  x=3  checks x<5(true)
              iv) y=6  x=4  checks x<5(true)
              v)  y=5  x=5  checks x<5(false). So it exit from while loop and print the value of x and y which is 5,5.
